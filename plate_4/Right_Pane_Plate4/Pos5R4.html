					Type II, Relief A, Transfer Roller Number 2.<br>
					Issued both imperforate and perforate.<br>
					Had this been a perforate copy then it would be Scott Number 20.</font>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The top row &quot;A&quot; relief on Plate 4 is the only row that has the FULL DESIGN at the top. Note that Ornaments &quot;S&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are complete. The plating of this particular stamp was done more or less by a &quot;committee of platers&quot; than by plating marks shown in the Ashbrook/Neinken diagrams. Many top row positions on plate 4 are similar, and also, due to plate wear, they changed their appearance notably in a short period of time. One of the most annoying aspects of trying to identify Plate 4 positions is the rapid change in appearance and the disappearing plating marks.</font></td>
