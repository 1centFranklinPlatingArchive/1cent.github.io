					Early impressions of this position are Type IIIa. As the plate wears, a break in the bottom curved line develops, thus this position becomes a Type III as shown here. (<a href="Pos73L4_b.html">Also see an another 73L4</a>)</font></td>

This position originally had an unbroken line but, as the plate wore, part of this line slowly disappeared. Since the top curved line is also missing, this technically makes this changeling position a Type III or a Scott Number 21. Also note that the Ashbrook/Neinken plating mark that normally is found in the &quot;E&quot; of ONE has cannot be seen on this impression. (<a href="Pos73L4_b.html">See other 73L4</a>)</font>
