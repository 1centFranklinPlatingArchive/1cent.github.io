					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Plate 4 changed it's appearance as many plating marks faded away due to plate wear, and new plating marks developed over the life of the plate. One of the most annoying aspects of trying to identify Plate 4 positions is the appearance and disappearance of these plating marks.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Other plating notes:<br>Neinken illustrates a dot in the S of POST, a vertical plate scratch or line of color in between Ornament L/M and a faint vertical line along side of Ornament R extending down towards the right plume. The digital part of this archive holds 5 unique images of this position and these marks are not consistent. Not illustrated in the Neinken plating diagram is a faint blur of color in the S of U.S. Some impressions will show this blur extending upwards between Ornaments U/V (see figure 4 below) and on into the top margin. The bottom line beneath &quot;E CE&quot; is unusually faint on 2L4. There is also a faint bottom line on 3L4, but only beneath the &quot;CE&quot;. These features are useful in plating the positions.</font></p>
