					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">On first inspection, Plate 4 seems simple, but the closer one looks, the harder it becomes. A confused mass of plating marks that seem to never quite match the published diagrams, six reliefs instead of the familiar three from the previous plates 1 thru 3, plating marks that disappear and new ones that show up later in the plates life, all this occurring in about a years worth of printing. The reconstruction of plate 4 will be difficult, so much so, that no sane person who is familiar with the philatelist's plating art and platers trick's would attempt to unravel. Fortunately, sanity has never been the platers primary concern. The quest to decipher this seemingly cryptographic nightmare has enthralled some of the greatest platers and philatelist's for well over a century now.</font>

					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Plate 4 is the first plate made with spacing large enough to introduce perforations in the vertical and horizontal spacing between stamps. It is also the first plate with six reliefs as opposed to the first 3 plates with 3 reliefs. In order to do this, a new transfer roll was made which philatelists simply call Transfer Roll No. 2. The old three relief roller (Called No.1) was set aside never to be used again. It is essential for the plating student to be able to identify the relief. This sometimes can be difficult on poorly centered perforated stamps with the designs cutoff on either the top or bottoms. We call the six reliefs &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; &quot;C,&quot; &quot;D,&quot; &quot;E, &quot; and &quot;F.&quot;</font>

This feature makes the identification of stamps from the top row very simple. All top row stamps from Plate 4 are Type II. Guide dots were placed above the upper right ornaments of all 20 positions in the top row. Extra dots were also included on 10L and 10R4.</font></td>

It should be noted that the top curved line of the right plume extends further down (or is more complete) than the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; relief. This is a helpful plating feature if the top ornaments of a stamp in question are cut off.</font>

The &quot;F&quot; relief stamps from this plate provide collectors with four different types: Ia, Ic, III and IIIa. It should be noted that because of the short entry on to the plate of sixth row postions and complete entry of the bottom part of the design of 10th row positions, the stamps of 6th and 10th row appear totally different. But, because of the relief flaw under the U of U.S. we can prove that 6th and 10th row stamps come from the same &quot;F&quot; relief roller position. Modern platers of the the One Cent simply differentiate the rows by adding either a 6 or 10 after the F. Hence F6 or F10.</font></p>
