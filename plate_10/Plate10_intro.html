					Not Feeling Scratched Up<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">This plate lacks the dramatic scatches found on the earlier Type V plates. Plate 10 shows very few individual plate characteristics. Very little traces were left of the relief mottles, and the plate exhibits few polishing scatches or lines, varieties that were prominent on the preceding plates.</font>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Seeing Double<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Plate 10 had only one minor double transfer, but it is so small (According to Neinken) that he felt it not worthy of listing. In fact he never reveals it's position, as it only appears in the earliest of impressions.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Center Line<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Plate 10 had no center line, it being one of the two plates of the total of 12 which were so made. Instead of a dividing line to seperate the two panes, a mark was made on the plate as a guide for seperating the sheets of stamps. This mark was placed between the tops of 10L and 1R10 and a similar mark was placed between 100L and 91R10. The two panes were very close together, the stamps of the left pane being only 3.5 mm from those of the right pane.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Still Under Construction, Perhaps You Like to Write.</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br>
					As you can probably tell by now, I have more fun photographing and plating positions than I do writing text and content. If you would like to write a paragraph or 2 of introduction before I do, email me.</font></td>
