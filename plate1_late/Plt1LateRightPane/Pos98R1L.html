					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#ffffcc">On Plate 1 in its original state (Plate 1 Early), positions 96 to 100R were entered with the &quot;A&quot; relief transfer roll. When the plate was reconditioned in the spring of 1852, to become what we call Plate 1 late, Positions 96R and 97R were re-entered with the &quot;B&quot; relief. Positions 98, 99 and 100 remained &quot;misplaced A reliefs&quot; as can be seen here.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#ffffcc">A plate bruise can be seen in the &quot;O&quot; and &quot;N&quot; of ONE. The 11th row effect can be seen at the bottom of the main image. Underneath most of the &quot;misplaced A reliefs&quot;, and particularly visible on Plate 1Early, are the remnants of the top of the &quot;B&quot; relief - which was beneath &quot;A&quot; on the transfer roll. Position 97R shows by far the strongest evidence of this. It is very remarkable on the early state, but still quite evident on the Late state as can be seen here. </font></td>
