					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">The EARLY state of the plate.<br>
					Positions 1R1E and 2R1E are in certain respects quite similar, in that their origins were identical. For both of these positions, the Type I relief roller was first used to enter these positions. An attempt was made to completely erase these positions (fresh-enter), but strong traces of both original entries remained after 1R1E and 2R1E were finally entered with the Type II relief roller. (which were further to the left by 0.75 mm than the final Type II relief roller entry)<br>
					<br>
					Proof of the entry of the Type I relief roller is found in several places on 1R1E, 2R1E, 1R1L and 2R1L. Note particularly the upper left Ornament &quot;S&quot; on 2R1E and 2R1L. On the original Type I relief this ornament is complete, whereas it was trimmed down on the &quot;T&quot; relief Type II roller. 2R1E and 2R1L shows both examples of this entry. Also the curved line shown directly above the &quot;S&quot; of US on 2R1E and 2R1L was part of the complete ornament &quot;V&quot; of the Type I relief roller. This line was cut away on the &quot;T&quot; relief Type II roller.<br>
					<br>
					The LATE state of the plate shown here.<br>
					The third and final reentry from 1E to 1L must have been performed very carefully on this position, and the only difference noted is that ornament L is very weak on the early state, and somewhat restored on the late state. All the remains of the DT on the early state seem to still be present on the late state. However, the 2 dots in the top margin above &quot;OS&quot; do not seem to occur on the early state. All the remains of the double transfer marks shown here can also be found on 2R1E. In the LATE state, 2 dots in the top margin above &quot;OS&quot; appear as well as the bottom double recut lines.<br>
