					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#ffffcc">On Plate 1 in its original state (Plate 1 Early), positions 96 to 100R were entered with the &quot;A&quot; relief transfer roll. When the plate was reconditioned in the spring of 1852, to become what we call Plate 1 late, Positions 96R and 97R were re-entered with the &quot;B&quot; relief roller. Positions 98, 99 and 100 remained &quot;A&quot; reliefs.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" color="#ffffcc">A plate bruise can be seen in Ornaments &quot;H and K&quot;.  Underneath most of the &quot;misplaced A reliefs&quot;, and particularly visible on Plate 1Early, are the remnants of the top of the &quot;B&quot; relief - which was beneath &quot;A&quot; on the transfer roll. Position 97R shows by far the strongest evidence of this. It is very remarkable on the early state, but still quite evident on the Late state. </font></td>
