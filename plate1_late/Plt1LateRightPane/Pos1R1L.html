					Positions 1R1E and 2R1E are in certain respects quite similar, in that their origins were identical. For both of these positions, the Type I relief roller was first used to enter these positions. An attempt was made to completely erase these positions (fresh-enter), but strong traces of both original entries remained after 1R1E and 2R1E were finally entered with the Type II relief roller. (which were further to the left by 0.75 mm than the final Type II relief roller entry)<br>

					The LATE state of the plate shown here.<br>
					The third and final reentry from 1E to 1L must have been performed very carefully on this position, and the most obvious difference noted is the addition of the bottom recut line. </font></td>
