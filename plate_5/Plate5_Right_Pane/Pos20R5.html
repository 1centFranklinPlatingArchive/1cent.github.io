					Ornaments L, M and N on stamps coming from the 2nd horizontal row right pane exhibit various combinations of shortness or completeness. The different combinations can be helpful in quickly narrowing down position possibilities. 20R5 shows Ornaments L/M and N are incomplete on this position, with L being more incomplete than M.<br>
