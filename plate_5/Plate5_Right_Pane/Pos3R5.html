This &quot;Ornament X/Y blur&quot; occurs on Positions 1L5 to 10L5 and 1R5 to 6R5. It was produced by a bit of foreign matter adhering to the transfer roll. The first position it occurs on, 6R5, shows this feature the strongest. It gradually became weaker with each successive entry, working right to left, until it became very faint on 1L5. Neinken notes this as a plating mark on the plating diagrams for a few positions, namely 2-9-10L5 and 5R5. See Figure 4, below.<br>
