					Ornaments L, M and N on stamps coming from the 2nd horizontal row right pane exhibit various combinations of shortness or completeness.  The different combinations can be helpful in quickly narrowing down position possibilities.  12R5 shows Ornament L as short, M is complete and N is weak but basically complete.</font></td>

(red arrows) These marks are shown in Neinken, but this photomicrograph shows the subtlety more accurately. These markings are consistent on this position. Many &quot;B&quot; reliefs have similar blurs, but they all have variation by position. A small piece of the Right Full Plume is visible. Most Type Va &quot;B&quot; relief positions do not have this feature, so it can be helpful in plating this position.</font>
