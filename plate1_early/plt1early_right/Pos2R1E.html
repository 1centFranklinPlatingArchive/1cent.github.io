				<td valign="top"><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Positions 1R1E and 2R1E are in certain respects quite similar, in that their origins were identical. For both of these positions, the Type I relief roller was first used to enter these positions. An attempt was made to completely erase these positions (fresh-enter), but strong traces of both original entries (which were further to the left by 0.75 mm than the final Type II entry) remained after 1R1E and 2R1E were finally entered with the Type II relief roller.</font>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Proof of the entry of the Type I relief roller is found in several places on 1R1E and 2R1E. Note particularly the upper left Ornament &quot;S&quot; on 2R1E. On the original Type I relief this ornament is complete, whereas it was trimmed down on the &quot;T&quot; relief Type II roller. 2R1E shows both examples. Also the curved line shown directly above the &quot;S&quot; of US on 2R1E was part of the complete ornament &quot;V&quot; of the Type I relief roller . This line was cut away on the &quot;T&quot; relief.</font></p>
					<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">All the remains of the double transfer marks shown here can also be found on 2R1L. However, 2 dots in the top margin above &quot;OS&quot; appear as well as the bottom double recut lines.</font></td>
