The horizontal scribe line mark is more helpful for plating this position and one can be seen below the &quot;O&quot; and &quot;N&quot; of ONE. This scribe line has been confirmed as consistent on 3 other copies of 9L8. There is also a second, very faint horizontal line, cutting across the &quot;E&quot; of ONE.
