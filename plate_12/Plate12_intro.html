					The Reliefs<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">The transfer roller made for this plate is called No. 6. It had three reliefs, and these are designated as &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C.&quot; The &quot;A&quot; relief was only used on the top row of the plate, 20 positions, 1L thru 10L12 and 1R thru 10R12. The &quot;A&quot; relief is a true Type II. The &quot;B&quot; Relief, which is also a Type II was used to enter the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th rows of the RIGHT PANE, and also the entire 2nd row of the LEFT PANE. The relief roller then got confused and entered various positions in the 4th and 9th rows inclusively. The &quot;C&quot; relief is a Type I. This relief was practically the full die design, all ornaments being complete except the left top corner which was minus its top line. Due the the &quot;ironing out&quot; effect and perhaps some short transfers, all the positions entered on the plate do not show a complete relief design or TRUE type I. Close but not quite. The &quot;C&quot; relief was used to transfer the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 10th row of the RIGHT PANE and the entire 3rd and 10th rows of the LEFT PANE. It was also used for various positions in the 4th and 9th rows of this pane.</font>
