					This plate had two outstanding characteristics. The designs of the six reliefs were not as sharp as those of Plates 7 or 8, and the right side ornaments on most of the designs are considerably shorter than on the designs of Plates 7 and 8. Clearly extensive burnishing was done on the plate between the vertical rows. Perhaps to make room for perforations, which had been introduced to production 2 years earlier. (From Ashbrook and Neinken) Many students of this issue today believe the vertical gutters had sufficient room for perforations and that the true cause could be: (1) These lines on the relief roller were wearing off, or (2) the ornaments were unintentionally shortened in the plate finishing process which takes place after all entries had been rocked into the steel (this includes flattening the plate, removing ridges between entries, burnishing, polishing etc.) before the plate is ready for the printing press. An area for student s of this issue to study further would be to examine and measure Plate 10's side ornaments to determine if they are as short or shorter than Plate 9 subjects. This would lend credence to theory (1) that the relief roller wore out.</font></td>

					Feeling Scratched Up<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">The most prominent feature of Plate 9 is the fine plate scratch lines found in various places on both sides of the panes. These lines are somewhat similar to the scratch marks found on Plate 5 and 7, but on Plate 9 they are not straight. These scratches are also distinctly different from the long horizontal scratch marks found on Plate 8. In many parts of the plate, and from the random directions in which they run, they have the appearance of surface cracks. Such, however was not their origin. A concentration of scratches can easily be seen on Positions 33, 34, 35, 44, 45, 46L9.</font>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Flaws<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Plate 9 produced two flaws, one which is really outstanding, the other quite minor. Position 10L9 is listed in the Scott's US Catalogue as the ear ring variety. This unusual flaw was known and named long before Neinken's time and doesn't really look like an ear ring. It is more like a large blister below the jowl and on the side of the neck. The origin of the flaw is clearly an imperfection in the plate steel of the printing plate.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">The minor flaw can be found on Position 38L9. Early impressions show this quite clearly, but on late impressions it is easily overlooked as a blur of color.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Seeing Double<br>
					</b></font><a href="Plate9_RightPane/Pos52R9.html"><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Position 52R9</font></a><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"> is the largest of the Type V double transfers, and ranks as one of the finest examples of this variety among all the stamps of the classics era. Although called a double transfer it is not properly a variety of this character because it is neither a fresh entry or a re-entry, but rather an error of transfer roll setting. Position 52R9 is from the &quot;F&quot; relief and was properly transferred. The extra design or &quot;double transferred&quot; image is of a &quot;B&quot; relief which was only used for the second horizontal row. While entering the 4 positions (62-72-82-92R9) below 52R9, the transfer roll setting was too low. Thus the bottom of the &quot;B&quot; relief provided the extra design on 52R9 because it did not &quot;mesh&quot; or align correctly as it was intended to.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Center Line<br>
					</b></font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Center line copies from Plate 9 can be easily identified by the heavy center line which divided the two panes. This line is approximately 1.75 to 1.82mm from stamps of the left pane and 1.58 to 1.70mm on the left pane. It is measured from the small ornament between Ornaments A and B or Ornaments L and M. The centerline is 0.3mm thick. Almost twice the width of centerlines from plates 5, 7 and 8. For more detailed information see <a href="../centerline_DB.html">the centerline database</a>.</font></p>

					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">As you can probably tell by now, I have more fun photographing and plating positions than I do writing text and content. If you would like to write a paragraph or 2 of introduction before I do, e-mail me.</font></td>
