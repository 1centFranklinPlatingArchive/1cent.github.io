Dennis has also been extremely helpful in spotting areas in need of correction within the Archive and his help is very much appreciated.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="#ffcc00">Dick Celler,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2"><br>
					For always being there and helping me with late night typographical trainwrecks and for cross checking my work. Dick has also provided the Archive with 69R4 and 70R4 as well as many positions of Plate 9 and 10 which he and I feel is poorly documented in the Ashbrook/Neinken plating diagrams. Dick has also contributed his time and centerline measurement data to help fill out the many missing positions in the centerline database. Dick has also been extremely helpful in spotting areas in need of clarification and corrections within the Archive and his help is very much appreciated.<br>

Mark has also helped me with some cross checking and has provided me with some great comments for updates and clarity. </font></p>

Jim has also generously provided several financial donations which are desprerately needed to help offset the costs of maintaining such a large online database. Jims contribution of 76R2 for photography helped confirm a newly discovered plating mark.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="#ffcc33">Chris Baisan<br>
					</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Chris provided several Plate 2 positions, most notable being 7L2 and several Plate 1Late positions.
