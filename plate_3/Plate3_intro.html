That is to say that 3 reliefs where used to enter the plate. Namely the &quot;T&quot; relief for the top row, the &quot;A&quot; relief for the 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th rows, and the &quot;B&quot; relief for the 3rd, 5th , 7th and 9th and 10th rows. The designs of Plate 2 and 3 are not as finely engraved as subjects from Plate 1 and early impressions from Plate 3 are are in a somewhat lighter blue shade. They seem to have a slightly bluish gray cast.</font></td>

					I am Cracking Up<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Many positions from Plate 3 show surface cracks. No stamps from Plate 2 show similar surface cracks in the parts of the designs, although there are a number of positions from Plate 2 that show scratches in the margins and under the bottom row of stamps.</font></td>

					Guide Dots<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">While the distribution of guide dots is the same as the earlier plates, the location of the guide dots for Plate 3 are quite different. Attention should be given to the double guide dots on practically every top row position of Plate 3.</font>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b><br>
					Ink Film<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">A characteristic ink film is found on many positions of Plate 3 stamps. These are usually from early impressions from the plate. This film is similar to the ink film found on Plate 12 stamps.The school of thought about ink film is that when the plate was first used, the surface was not highly polished and in many places was pitted with minute needle like impressions. These held the ink and resulted in in a very noticeable film covering part or all of the stamp.</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Mottling<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">From Stanley Ashbrook' Book, Page 215</font></p>
					<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">&quot;Mottling is a term we apply to certain 1&cent; stamps which show imperfect places in the surface of the steel plate, due no doubt to the hardening process. Printed stamps from such places on the plate exhibit the defect as blotches of color. Very early impressions from Plate 3 may show a combination of ink film and mottling. Such imperforate stamps come only from this plate.&quot; (Plate 3)</font></td>

					Center Line<br>
					</b></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">Center line imperforates come from Plate 1 Early and Late, Plate 3 and Plate 4. Plate 2 had no center line, but Plate 2 did have a fine scribe line between the two panes. Measurement of the distance of the center line from the design gives a quick solution to determine a Plate 3 stamp. On Plate 3 Left Pane, the distance is 4.5 mm and from the right pane the distance is 4 mm.</font></td>
