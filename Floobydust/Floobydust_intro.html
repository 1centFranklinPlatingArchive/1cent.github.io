Around 1984, when I was just a gossling Electrical Engineer, the senior engineers would go home at 4 p.m. There day would consist of cursing and spitting at circuits they had designed that didn't work right. They would come to me at 3:50 p.m. and say &quot;Richard, see if you can figure out what </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2" color="#ffcc00">&quot;<a href="#Anchor">we</a>&quot;<sup>(1)</sup></font><font color="#ffffcc" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><i> </i>did wrong&quot;. If I fixed the bug, the next day the CEO would have the engineer responsible for the circuit buy me lunch from the roach coach. If I couldn't find the bug, more often than not, the design would end up in the Floobydust drawer of dead circuits.</font></td>

And my Floobydust drawer is the internet. This is where I stick the stamps that I couldn't plate in an hour or 2. Perhaps you might see something that I missed or might want to take a stab at plating a real tough one. You'll find them here. </font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular" size="2">I will also try to provide all the info I know about the &quot;floobydust ones&quot; and will stick arrows and notes to anything that appears important.</font><font color="#ffffcc" size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"> Remember that it's supoosed to be fun, so if you are staring at the computer monitor for more than an hour....that's not fun. If you do manage to plate a Floobydust position, I will buy you a lunch from the roach coach. Just remember..It's fun until someone loses an eye!<br>
